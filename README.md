# NMEP Homework 3: Computer Vision Model Zhu
This assignment should be done in the following order:

1. Complete the ```HW 3 Model Zhu [Part 1]``` assignment on Gradescope. This should give you some intuition behind the codebase.
2. Go through the HW 3 page on the NMEP website to implement AlexNet and ResNet! You will need to fill out corresponding answer fields on the ```HW 3 Model Zhu [Part 2]``` assignment on Gradescope as you go.

Your deliverables for this homework are:

- Both Part 1 and Part 2 Assignments
- Kaggle submission and writeup (more details on NMEP website!)
- Github repo with all of your code! You need to first fork this repo and clone it on honeydew. Then include the link to your fork in the Part 2 Gradescope assignment. If you would like to make your repo private, please DM us and we'll send you the GitHub usernames to add as collaborators.
